	 <ul><li><p align="justify">Order management software-Complete order management allows you to manage all of your customers, view revenue, sales<img border="0" src="images/benefits.jpg" align="right" width="130" height="153"> dates, voice authorization information on each customer, and everything you need to stay on top of your business. 
	 Please CLICK HERE to see a demo of the order management system.</p></li>
	 <li><p align="justify">&nbsp;Up-to-date Do Not Call list-Scrubbing of all orders BEFORE they are billed is key to your business. 
	 All orders are sent scrubbed against the national do not call list. We have full access to the new and updated list each month which we run a negative search against the list. (ensures no fines)</p></li>
	 <li><p align="justify">&nbsp;LIVE Voice Verification-Our state of the art, one of a kind voice verification system is used for every order that is generated. This is a full automated system that is created and tailored for each merchant to use for verifying the sale. 
	 The voice verification records the terms and conditions, refund policy, and payment details to the customer. Once the customer agrees to the terms in the verification, a unique contract number is provided by the system that will need to be entered in with each order by the call center. 
	 Each night, all of the verification tapes produced that day are listened to by a LIVE OPERATOR who listens to the tapes and accepts or rejects them based on customer?s responses. 
	 Any NO answer to a question, unclear answer, hesitant answer, pressured answer, or fraud is automatically kicked out of the system and permanently blacklisted. All YES answers, which are complete and confident answers, are accepted and sent to the bank for billing. 
	 All orders are verified by our in house operators, as no order is billed until customer agrees to the terms, conditions, and charge. This ensures that all customers billed, are positive orders. 
	 For maximum security, we set a 2 tape per customer limit, this way a call center cannot keep verifying over and over to get the customer to say yes on tape. 
	 Lastly, to ensure that confident answers are given, we don?t process any orders where the customer is over the age of 65/Senior Citizens.</p></li>
	 <li><p align="justify">&nbsp;Black list order scrubbing-Removes problematic customers with chargeback history/NSF.</p></li> 
	 <li><p align="justify">&nbsp;No duplicate orders-Ensures customers are not being loaded up. By not allowing any customers to be billed more than one time in a 6 month time period (unless it's a recurring charge by the same merchant) this helps ensure that the customer does not have multiple charges on their bill by telemarketing companies.</p></li>
	 <li><p align="justify">&nbsp;24/7 Live Customer service/State-of-the-art IVR system-Fields 100% of incoming customer service calls- In a sense, we are the front line, fielding all initial incoming calls from customers. Our state of the art call center takes calls around the clock, and dispatches customers to each client processing transactions with us. 
	 All customers who wish to cancel are credited at time of call, all other customer inquiries are logged and directed to the call centers customer service. Please note that all directed calls are logged and must be reported with the outcome of the call within three business days. 
	 All inquiries that are not termed as satisfactory or failure to provide the outcome of the call will result in the customer being credited.</p></li>
	 <li><p align="justify">&nbsp;Shipping verification-We require each merchant to ship their product using UPS only, to their customers within 7 days from the sale date and requires a signature and tracking number for each package that is sent out. 
	 We then verify each tracking number with the verification contract number and customer details to ensure a 100% match. This guarantees that each and every package that is sent to the customer is received by them and signed for.</p></li>
	 <li><p align="justify">&nbsp;Follow up letter sent to customer to ensure satisfaction-3 days after the order is billed, a follow up letter/invoice is sent to the customer outlining their recent purchase over the phone.
	 It also serves the purpose of providing the customer with a way to dial up our system and access the voice authorization confirming their purchase. This way the customer can listen to them self giving authorization to buy over the phone, view the total $ amount charged to them, the company contact information, etc.
