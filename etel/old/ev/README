Eventum Issue Tracking System
=============================

Eventum is a user friendly and very flexible issue tracking system, that can
be used by a support department to track incoming technical support requests,
or by a software development team to quickly organize tasks and bugs. Eventum
is used by MySQL AB for its support needs, and has allowed us to increase our
response times by leaps and bounds.

It is being released as a GPL project to gather community involvement in its
development. The BitKeeper source tree is available from the following URL:

  http://mysql.bkbits.net/

We have also provided mailing lists related to Eventum, both for users and
potential developers at http://lists.mysql.com/:

  eventum-users@lists.mysql.com
  eventum-devel@lists.mysql.com

We welcome you to send patches, bug fixes and other contributions to Eventum.
Please see the CONTRIB file for more details into how to do so.
