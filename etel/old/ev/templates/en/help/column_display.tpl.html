<h4>Edit Columns to Display</h4>
<span class="default">
This page allows you to dynamically control which columns are displayed on the list issues page.<br /><br />

You can set the minimum role required to view a column. For example, if you set the mimimum role for 'Category'
to be 'Manager' anyone with a role lower then 'Manager' will not be able to see that column. To hide a column
from all users, select 'Never Display'.<br /><br />

Please note that some columns may be hidden even if you specify they should be shown. For example, if no releases
are defined in the system the 'Release' column will be hidden.
