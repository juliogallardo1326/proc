<h4>Customize Issue Listing Screen</h4>
<span class="default">
This page allows you to dynamically configure the values displayed in the 
"Status Change Date" column in the issue listing screen, for a particular
project.
<br /><br />
This column is useful to display the amount of time since the last change
in status for each issue. For example, if issue #1234 is set to status
'Closed', you could configure Eventum to display the difference
in time between "now" and the date value stored in the closed date
field.
<br /><br />
Since the list of statuses available per project is dynamic and 
database driven, this manual process is needed to associate a status
to a date field coming from the database.
