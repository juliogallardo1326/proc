<h4>Edit Fields to Display</h4>
<span class="default">
This page allows you to dynamically control which fields are displayed 
to users of a certain minimum role.
For example, you could use this page so that only users of the role "<i>standard user</i>" 
(and higher ranking roles) are able to set the category or 
release fields when reporting a new issue.
