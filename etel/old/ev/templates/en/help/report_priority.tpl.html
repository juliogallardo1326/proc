<h4>Priority Field</h4>
<span class="default">
This field is used to prioritize issues, as to make project management
a little easier. If you are not sure, or don't know what the appropriate
priority should be for new issues, choose 'not prioritized' as the 
option and leave the issue to be prioritized by a project manager.
<br /><br />
Note: The values in this field can be changed by going in the administration
section of this application and editing the appropriate atributes of
a project. If you do not have the needed permissions to do so, please
contact your local Eventum administrator.
