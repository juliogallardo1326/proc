<h4>Estimated Development Time Field</h4>
<span class="default">
This field is used by the reporters of new issues to estimate the 
total development time for the issue. It is especially important as a 
metrics tool to get a simple estimate of how much time each issue will
take from discovery, going through implementation and testing up until
release time.
<br /><br />
This field can also be used as a way to check the estimation abilities
of project managers against the impact analysis given by the 
developers themselves. That is, the value entered by a project manager
here can be compared against the impact analysis / estimated 
development time entered by the developers, and this way get more 
experience estimating the required time for new projects.
