<h4>Associate Emails</h4>
<span class="default">
This screen allows users with the appropriate permissions to associate
emails with existing issues, or create new issues and 
associate emails with them.
<br /><br />
In order to do that, however, the administrator of the system needs
to configure email accounts to make the software download
the email messages from the appropriate POP3/IMAP server.
<br /><br />
One of the optimal uses of this feature is to create a separate 
'issues' or 'support' POP3/IMAP account and ask your customers or 
end-users to send support questions, issues or suggestions to that 
mailbox. Eventum will then download the emails and provide 
them to the users of the system.
