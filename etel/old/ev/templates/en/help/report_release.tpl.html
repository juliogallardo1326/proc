<h4>Scheduled Release Field</h4>
<span class="default">
This field is used to determine what the deadline should be for when
this new issue should be completed and resolved. If you don't know 
what the deadline should be for this new issue, leave the field as
'un-scheduled', and a project manager will set it appropriately.
<br /><br />
Note: The values in this field can be changed by going in the administration
section of this application and editing the appropriate atributes of
a project. If you do not have the needed permissions to do so, please
contact your local Eventum administrator.
