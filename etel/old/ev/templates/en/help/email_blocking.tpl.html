<h4>Email Blocking</h4>
<span class="default">
To prevent inappropriate emails reaching the notification list, only users that are assigned
to the issue are allowed to email through Eventum. If an un-authorized
user sends an email to <i>issue-XXXX@example.com</i> it is converted into a note and
stored for later use. This note can be converted into an email at a later date.
