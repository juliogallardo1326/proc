You can create canned email responses and use them when sending emails from the
system. That is an useful feature when dealing with lots of issues that relate
to the same problem.
<br /><br />
If no canned email responses are available through the Email window, please
contact an user with the appropriate permissions (administrator or manager) to 
add some for you.
