                                Each ETEL900 charge that is applied to a consumer&#8217;s 
                                telephone bill is collected from the phone carrier 
                                by ETeleGate. The typical phone billing cycle 
                                is one month in duration following the transaction. 
                                The Carrier pays ETeleGate a remittance, net of 
                                their fees, approximately 30 days after the end 
                                of the next billing cycle. You get paid by ETeleGate 
                                once those funds have been received from the telephone 
                                carrier.<br>
                                Please Note: ETeleGate will only pay you for those 
                                transactions for which ETeleGate has been paid. 
                                Collection rates can vary by localities and historical 
                                data indicates that as much as 20% of all 900 
                                transactions may go uncollected. ETeleGate has 
                                no control over these collection factors.<br>

                                As is customary in the pay per call industry, 
                                ETeleGate withholds as a security deposit 20% 
                                of the total ETEL900 revenues processed during 
                                the associated billing period. This security deposit 
                                will be used to cover ETeleGate for losses in 
                                the event that refunds, returns, uncollectables, 
                                or charge backs (collectively, disputes) should 
                                exceed revenue for any given time frame on your

                                be applied to disputes on YOUR ACCOUNT ONLY. Any

                                will be refunded to you in the billing period
