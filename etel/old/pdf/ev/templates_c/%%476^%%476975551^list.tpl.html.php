<h4>Listing / Searching for Issues</h4>
<span class="default">
The Issue Listing page uses a grid layout to simplify the manual
search for issues in a project. You may sort for (almost) any column
in this grid form, and users with the appropriate permissions may also
assign selected issues to another user.
<br /><br />
The quick search table in the top of the screen helps the users find
the issues they want quickly. More advanced searches may be created
using the Advanced Search tool.
