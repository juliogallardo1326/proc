<br /><br />
Virtual Terminal replaces standard authorization terminals or software, and provides the best solution for merchants who manually enter credit card transactions for mail or phone order sales.

<br /><br />
e-Merchant suits businesses of all sizes because it reduces the complexity and expense normally associated with authorizing and processing credit card transactions. It is much faster compares to conventional usage of credit card machines.

Cross-marketing or co-branding are also made possible here! As long as you are an Etelegate member, you can buy or sell anywhere, with any Etelegate member at anytime.
