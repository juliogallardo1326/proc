<b>If you elect to use your checking account to purchase a subscription to this website, an ACH debit will be drawn on your account.  Your agreement with these Terms & Conditions is your approval for Etelegate to issue an ACH debit to your account. </b>

<b>4. Payment/Fee </b>
</p><p>
Sites may have periodic subscription fees that are defined by the owners of the site at the time of the initial enrollment for subscription.  The member is responsible for such fees according to the terms of the site.  Once a member has the ability to access the site using the Username and Password assigned to the member, subscription fees become non-refundable. 
</p><p>
<b>5.Automatic Recurring Billing (If Selected By You On The Sign Up Page) </b>
</p><p>
As determined by the content provider of the site, subscription fees may be automatically renewed at the end of the original term selected, for a similar period of time, unless notice is received from the subscriber a set number of days before renewal.

</p><p>
<b>6.	Electronic Receipt </b>
</p><p>
Subscribers will receive an email receipt to his or her email provided upon initial subscription.  Subscriber, at any time, may request a copy of the account of charges made for the life of his or her membership to the site.  Subscriber foregoes this right if such request is not made.

At any time, and without cause, subscription to the service may be terminated by either Etelegate, the site, or the subscriber upon notification of the other by electronic or conventional mail, or by telephone or fax.  When the member requests the termination, subscription fees are NOT refunded.  Subscribers are liable for charges incurred by them until termination of service. 
</p><p>
If you request cancellation or request a refund from Etelegate, your bank, card issuer, or phone company due to unauthorized or fraudulent use, Etelegate can at its discretion, to prevent further unauthorized use, block your information from use at all Etelegate clients’ websites.  This, however, will not prevent unauthorized use at non-Etelegate clients’ websites, and is not a substitution for your contacting your appropriate channels to prevent further misuse.

If the free trial is cancelled within the timeframe allowed by the website, it typically takes the banking system 7 to 10 days to remove the credit card hold from these funds.  Please understand that Etelegate has no way to remove this hold.  During the trial period and for a minimum of 7 to 10 days after you cancel, these funds are considered out of your bank even though technically they are still there, and you could overdraw or exceed the limits of your account.  You are responsible for any charges imposed by your credit card issuing bank for exceeding your account limits or overdrawing your account. 
</p><p>

being viewed and are at least 18 years of age in the US (21 in AL, MS, NE, and WY), who wish to access visual 
images, audio sounds, and verbal descriptions of a sexually oriented and frankly erotic nature.  Materials

nudity or sexual acts and should not be accessed by anyone who is not of legal age in the jurisdiction 
where this site is being viewed and are at least 18 years of age in the US (21 in AL, MS, NE, and WY), 
by anyone who finds such material offensive in nature, or by anyone who simply does not wish to be exposed

following statements: “I affirm and swear that as of this moment, under penalty of Perjury, I am of legal 
age in the jurisdiction where this site is being viewed and are at least 18 years of age in the US 
(21 in AL, MS, NE, and WY).  I will not permit any persons who are not of legal age in the jurisdiction
where this site is being viewed and are at least 18 years of age in the US (21 in AL, MS, NE, and WY) 
to view or access in any way any materials found on this website.  I understand that by accessing this

and sexual acts.  I affirm that I am not offended by such materials, and that such materials are legal 
in my community.  I am volunteering to view, hear, and access such materials on my own volition, and I 
choose to do so because I want to view/read/hear or otherwise access such materials for my own enjoyment, 
information or entertainment.  My choice is a manifestation of my interest in such matters, which is 
healthy and normal, and is also held by most adults in my area.  I am completely familiar with the 
standards held in my community, and the material I expect to access in this site falls within these 
standards. In my experience, the average adult in my community accepts the consumption of such materials 
by willing adults in circumstances such as this, which offer reasonable insulation from the materials for 
minors, and unwilling adults.  Adults in my community will accept the standards displayed within this site, 
and will not find any of the material patently offensive.”
