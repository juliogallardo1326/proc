                          All calculations for payouts are based on transaction 
                          weeks. A transaction week runs from midnight (00:00:00) 
                          Monday morning to 23:59:59 Sunday night.</p>

                          the pay period. For ACH it generally will hit your account 
                          within two days (exceptions are holidays and weekends). 
                          Wires usually will arrive in your bank account within

                          Etelegate.com has a 3 week initial delay after the pay

                          You will receive a disbursement after the delay as explained 
                          above. For example, your transactions started on Monday, 
                          February 7th 2005 and ended on Sunday February 13th 
                          2005. This would be your first transaction week. Then 
                          you processed 2 more weeks which would conclude your 
                          second and third transaction week. <br>
                          Your first settlement would go out on Monday, March 
                          7th 2005, and reach your account on March 9th or 10th 
                          via ACH, and a few days later via wire transfer payments. 
                          In short, you will always be paid three weeks in the 
                          arrears of your ending initial pay period.</p>

                          credits or charge backs. The amount of withholding is 
                          10% of your GROSS Sales, and so long as there are not 
                          excessive credits or charge-backs is returned to you 
                          in approximately 180 days with a future payout.</p>

                          should I trust your company?</span><br>
                          etelegate.com would like to ask you this question. Your 
                          company will be using our merchant accounts, so we have 
                          to ensure that all business is good business. A transaction 
                          can be disputed up to 1 year after the card was processed 
                          with some banks, so our company effectively loans you 
                          this money for this duration. </p>
